# Iris Classification Project

This project is a machine learning model built using a Decision Tree Classifier to classify iris species. The model uses features such as sepal and petal dimensions to predict whether an iris flower belongs to the species `setosa`, `versicolor`, or `virginica`.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset from Scikit-learn, which consists of 150 samples with four features each:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Instructions

To run this project:
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1903vishal20/iris-classification.git

pip install -r requirements.txt

Model
The model used is a Decision Tree Classifier, which achieves an accuracy of around 95% on the test data.

Visualizations
Pair plot of features colored by species.
Confusion matrix heatmap to visualize classification results.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn


3. Save the file, then stage and commit it:

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README file"
   git push
